 <p id="bio"> Milton Berle was born on July 12, 1908 in New York City. He was a comedian and actor. He was called "Mr. Televison" or "Uncle Miltie" often because he was popular on TV. He started acting at the age of 10 in vaudeville acts. After that he started working as late night comedian. He later then started growing up both in the acting buisness and as a person. He later then grew and started going into Movies and even into a Televison Series called Texaco Star Theater. He remained a big star and stopped working in his older ages. He was 93 years old before he died and he is still remembered in TV shows today. </p>
